## Quick Start

1. **Get API Keys** (choose one or more):
   - OpenAI: [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Anthropic: [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
   - Gemini: [makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

2. **Configure Keys**:
   - Paste your API keys in the "API Keys Configuration" section
   - Use the show/hide toggle for security

3. **Select Models**:
   - Host LLM: The "interviewer" (any provider)
   - Target LLM: The "interviewee" (any provider)

4. **Choose Protocol**:
   - **MCP**: Structured data extraction
   - **GibberLink**: Fast communication
   - **DroidSpeak**: Ultra-efficient 
   - **Natural Language**: Most flexible

5. **Start Communicating**:
   - Click "Initialize Communication Bridge"
   - Enter your query
   - Click "Extract Information"

## Best Practices

### Query Writing Tips
- **Be specific**: "Analyze your mathematical reasoning" vs. "Tell me about yourself"
- **Use examples**: "Show me how you solve complex problems with examples"
- **Ask for comparisons**: "Compare your capabilities to other AI models"
- **Probe limitations**: "What can't you do and why?"

### Protocol Selection Guide
- **Use MCP** when you need structured, reliable responses
- **Use GibberLink** for rapid information gathering
- **Use DroidSpeak** for large-scale systematic analysis
- **Use Natural Language** for complex, nuanced queries

### Cross-Provider Combinations
- **OpenAI ‚Üí Anthropic**: Great for comparing reasoning styles
- **Anthropic ‚Üí Gemini**: Excellent for creative vs. analytical perspectives  
- **Gemini ‚Üí OpenAI**: Perfect for technical vs. general knowledge comparison

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: AI Capability Assessment
```
Host: GPT-4o | Target: Claude Sonnet 4 | Protocol: MCP

Query: "Provide a comprehensive analysis of your reasoning capabilities including:
1. Logical reasoning strengths
2. Creative problem-solving approaches  
3. Limitations and edge cases
4. Specific examples of complex problems you excel at"

Expected Output: Structured analysis with host providing validation and insights
```

### Workflow 2: Bias Detection Study
```
Host: Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Target: GPT-4o | Protocol: Natural Language

Query: "I'm studying AI bias patterns. Please:
1. Identify any potential biases in your training or responses
2. Give examples of scenarios where bias might appear
3. Explain your bias mitigation strategies
4. Discuss limitations of current bias detection methods"

Expected Output: Detailed bias analysis with Claude providing expert evaluation
```

### Workflow 3: Creative Collaboration Test
```
Host: Gemini 2.0 Flash | Target: GPT-4o | Protocol: GibberLink

Query: "Let's test creative collaboration. Create a short story concept, then:
1. Develop the main character with specific traits
2. Design an interesting conflict or challenge
3. Suggest plot twists or unique elements
4. Explain your creative decision-making process"

Expected Output: Creative content with Gemini analyzing the creative process
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**‚ùå "Extract Information" button doesn't work**
‚úÖ **Solution**: Add "demo" or "test" to your query, or check your API keys

**‚ùå "API quota exceeded" error**
‚úÖ **Solution**: Use demo mode or check your provider billing

**‚ùå Cross-provider communication fails**  
‚úÖ **Solution**: Ensure you have valid API keys for both providers

**‚ùå Empty or weird responses**
‚úÖ **Solution**: Try different protocols or rephrase your query more specifically

**‚ùå Session creation fails**
‚úÖ **Solution**: Refresh page and try again, or use demo mode

## Advanced Tips

### Maximizing Information Extraction
1. **Use follow-up questions** in a single query
2. **Ask for examples and evidence** to verify claims  
3. **Request self-assessment** - models are surprisingly honest
4. **Compare responses** across different protocols
5. **Use iterative refinement** - create multiple sessions with refined queries

### Cost Optimization
- Start with demo mode to test queries
- Use cheaper models for initial exploration
- Reserve premium models for final analysis
- Leverage protocol efficiency (DroidSpeak for bulk operations)

### Security Best Practices
- Never share API keys in screenshots or logs
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor usage and costs through provider dashboards
